### üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Work experience
Sber, ML engineer.
Tasks:
- Developed a reranking model for search and assistant retrival, which increased recommendation accuracy by 2x.
- Trained and optimized an embedder model for semantic search; the model runs 2x faster on user queries without losing quality.
- Researched and applied different approaches to build a RAG system. Wrote microservices on FastApi to bring the assistant into production.
- Used LLMs for downstream tasks.
- Built a knowledge graph: extract entities and connections from texts, enriching them with embeddings. The resulting graph was used for information retrieval and the identification of thematic communities.

League of Digital Economy, R&D ML engineer.
Tasks:
- Investigated the possible ways of fingerprint generation(GAN, VAE, Diffusion Models, VLM). Developed a GAN-based model to solve the problem.
- As part of the biometrics research task, trained the YOLO model on the task of detecting fingerprint phalanges and, applying OpenVINO, optimized it for low-latency inference on peripherals.

Glycemia Forecasting, Research ML engineer.
Tasks:
- As part of a research group, he studied approaches to predicting blood sugar levels in people with type 1 diabetes.
- Used rnn-like and transformer models to predict blood glucose.
- Developed a pipeline for preprocessing different data from various sources and implemented a methodology for generating synthetic samples.

Sber, Data Scientist.
Tasks:
- Worked with Greenplum: performed scoring analysis and developed customer churn forecasting models.
- Trained and optimized gradient bousting models and classical machine learning algorithms, and ensured their monitoring in production.
- Applied PySpark to perform ad-hoc big data analytics and operational extraction of business insights.
